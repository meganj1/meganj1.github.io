            <p>
              Ever since I got into college, I started cooking for myself and
              progressively got better at it. I used to not know how to crack an
              egg without leaving bits of shells in the bowl, but now I can make
              complicated dishes like beef noodles. The picture above is what I
              made during the summer following an recipe. I am really proud of
              myself for this since it requires a lot of ingredients and a long
              time to prepare. The final product was delicious, but I finished
              it in 20 minutes. Is it really worth spending two and a half hours
              on it though?

              My Nails Art Business
            </h3>
            <p>
              Over quarantine, I picked up a new hobby: doing gel nails. I have
              always been obsessed with getting my nails done. I wouldâ€™nt feel
              like myself if I dont have cute designs and vibrant colors on my
              nails. It was devastating for me not being able to go to a salon
              and get my fresh manicures. So I decided I will do it myself.
              Initially, I bought a cheap kit from Amazon that only had 7
              colors. I experimented a little and realize I am pretty good at
              it. Over the course of six months, I bought more tools and color
              sets. One day, my parents suggested, "why not start doing other
              people's nails and makesome money?" So I started my small business
              doing people's nails at home. Here are some designs I have made.

              My Other Hobbies
            </h3>
            <p>
              During my free time, I like to volunteer at places and help out
              the community. During summer, I would go to Brooklyn and make
              bouquets from leftover flowers from local supermarkets at a
              church. I have a picture of my favorite one below. I also enjoy
              running and hiking whenever I want to be active. I am not an
              athletic person at all, but I like feeling accomplished and
              refreshed after a run along the east river bank.
