              Some Intro to Horoscope
            </h3>
            <p>
              According to Wikipedia, the definition of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscope">horoscope</a> is
              "a forecast of a person's future, typically including a
              delineation of character and circumstances, based on the relative
              positions of the stars and planets at the time of that person's
              birth." I think these forecasts are pretty accurate for me, or at
              least I feel relatable to those defining charactistics of my
              signs.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we are going to look at today are my "big three." The big
              three are one's <a href="#Sun">sun</a>, <a href="#Moon">moon</a>,
              and <a href="#Rising">rising</a> sign. Let's take a look!

              Sun in Leo
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Sun determines your ego, identity, and "role" in life. It's
              the core of who you are, and is the sign you’re most likely to
              already know. My sun in Leo, meaning I am fundemantally bold and
              proud. I love attention and to be cared for. I pay it back in kind
              with your charm and your ability to make people feel better when
              they’re blue.

              Moon in Sagittarius
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely
              the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your
              personality when you’re alone or deeply comfortable. My Moon in
              Sagittarius, meaning my emotional self is restless,
              self-questioning, optimistic, and independent. I may hide my
              sensitivities behind an interest in finding new ways to feel.

              Rising in Sagittarius
            </h3>
            <p>
              Your rising or ascendent is the "mask" you present to people. It
              can be seen in your personal style and how you come off to people
              when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as you get
              older. My rising in Sagittarius, meaning I come across as
              independent, optimistic, and confident, though sometimes overly
              blunt or critical. Generally a charming conversationalist, my
              free-spritied approach may come off as restless or easily bored.
