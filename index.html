          <p>
            Hi! My name is Megan Jin. My real name is Meitong Jin. Fun fact, my
            parents paid $800 for my name from a superstitious naming agency in
            China. They said the agency checks my birth chart and chooses the
            characters that best balances the five elements. Maybe I inherited
            my family's superstition; I am really interested in astrology. I am
            a Leo sun, Sagittarius moon, and Sagittarius rising. If you have no
            idea what that means, I donâ€™t blame you. I will explain it in
            <a href="horoscope.html">my horoscope</a> page.

          <p>
            I was born and raised in Shenyang, a northeastern city in China.
            Both my parents have very big families on their sides, and since I
            am the youngest girl in my generation, I was always babied by my
            family. I have an older half-brother who is 38 years old (a
            17-year-old gap). He is happily married with a boy and a girl. I
            always hang out with his babies when I go back to China.

          <p>
            When I was 13 years old, my family decided to send me to an
            international school in Singapore. I spent a year there and made
            lots of great memories. After that, my family immigrated to the US,
            and we settled in Bay Area, California. After 4 years of high
            school, I got into my dream college NYU, and I even got to study
            aborad in my first year of college. I was part of the first year
            study away program in Liberal Studies, and I met some of my best
            friends there. Now, after a year at home due to covid, I am excited
            to finally be on the main campus. I am looking foward to my last two
            years of college expereince.
