            <p>
              I have always been a crazy cat person, but my parents always
              thought cats are mean and lazy creatures that don’t appreciate
              love and affection. I get their point but I don’t think it is fair
              to not give love to cats just because they are not as affectionate
              as dogs. After months of persuasion, my parents finally agreed to
              take me to a cat adoption fair. That is when I fell in love with
              Jaspurr at first sight. He was sitting quietly in his cage, unlike
              other kittens who were jumping around asking for attentions and
              pets. He has beautiful blue eyes, and he was staring at me the
              whole time we were there. I knew I had to take him home.

              His Catsonnality
            </h3>
            <p>
              Have you noticed the pun in his name yet? Jas-purr? Thank you. I
              think it is very creative too. Jaspurr is a very shy and gentle
              cat. He like to sleep in hidden corners and behind the furnitures
              so that no one can bother him when he gets his beauty sleep.
              However, at night he get his "crackhead hours" when he would jump
              around and cause chaos around the household. We can never get mad
              at him because he would purposely curl up on your feet. That
              gesture melts people's heart everytime.

              Where Is He Now?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Over the summer, I went back home to bay area and saw Jaspurr at
              home. My parents had to go back to China to see their family, so I
              told them I will take care of Jaspurr in NYC. I flew back to the
              city with Jaspurr, and he has been living in my apartnment. He has
              been a great roommate, and even killed a cockroach for us.
